## üèó Project Structure

So the purpose is to take the advantage of the type system of TypeScript and to use the power of Nx workspace to create multiple applications with the powerful framework Angular!

So we have 6 components:

1. Metadata (`components/metadata`) - manifest and static assets for extensions
2. Popup (`components/popup`) - used for the upper popup
3. Options (`components/options`) - used for the options page
4. DevTools Panel (`components/devtools-panel`) - used for the devtools panel
5. Background Script (`components/background-script`) - used for run background job [readmore](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/develop/concepts/service-workers)
6. Content Script (`components/content-script`) - script run in the context of web pages [readmore](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/develop/concepts/content-scripts)

In every Chrome extension we have background script that communicate with the content scripts, which can be found in `components/background-script/src/main.ts`.

We are also can inject content script which can be found in `components/content-script/src/main.ts`.

All the applications have already the Chrome types so can just use `chrome` and the editor will recognize it.
